# turkey_calculator
Interactive python script for calculating when a turkey is safe to eat.

Run the `turkey.py` (python) and answer the prompts.

Run a timer when cooking the turkey, and periodically measure the coldest temperature you can find inside the turkey.

Enter the time so far (in minutes) and the temperature you found (in fahrenheit) in your replies to the prompts.

The program will estimate when the turkey is safe to eat (reduction of 6.5D in salmonella)

While this is based on accepted food safety science, I make absolutely no warranty that this calculator ensures your turkey is safe to eat. In particular, it is very important you find the coldest part of the turkey.
